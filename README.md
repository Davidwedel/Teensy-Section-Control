# Teensy Section Controller for AgOpenGPS

Like the name says, this is Code for section control run on a teensy. It should be as close a copy of Brian's machine control code as is possible and run on a teensy. 

Note: I don't know if the Serial connection or the Hydraulic lift/GeoFence work. I haven't tried it ever.
